Western Governors University -- WGU -- has
[nine Bachelor of Science CS / IT majors](https://www.wgu.edu/landing/q4-2018-it).
I'm about to apply for admission, so it seems prudent to choose one
of them.  Therefore, I'm comparing the different courses that make
up each degree track.

As I expected, there is much overlap, and there are interesting
differences.

This Git repo is just to hold my spreadsheet, and any other docs I
generate or find useful in making my choice.
